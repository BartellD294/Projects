I have completed Part 1 of the Nand2Tetris project at https://www.nand2tetris.org/.
In this project, I created a simulated computer from the ground up, beginning with only NAND logic gates. I used these NAND gates to create the other elementary logic gates, then used those gates to create more complex parts such as multiplexors, demultiplexors, and registers. I used these complex parts to create more advanced parts including ALUs, RAM, and a CPU - then I combined those advanced parts to create a simulated simple computer that is capable of performing instructions dictated by 16-bit buses.
Finally, I created an assembler to translate low-level assembly language into the binary machine code that is used by the computer.

Unfortunately, I cannot currently publicly upload my code for the project here because it may violate my university's academic policies, as this project is used for one of the university's courses, and other students could copy my code if it was publicly available.
